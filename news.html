    <h2>Laundry Detergent</h2>
    <p>
        Start by selecting the right type of laundry detergent: powder, liquid, or pods. 
        - <strong>Powder</strong> is good for general cleaning and stain removal. 
        - <strong>Liquid</strong> is effective for pre-treating stains. 
        - <strong>Pods</strong> offer convenience with pre-measured doses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Always read the instructions on the label for specific dosing guidelines and measure carefully to avoid using too much, as this can leave residue on your clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, sort your laundry by color, fabric type, and washing temperature. This helps prevent color bleeding and ensures that fabrics are washed appropriately. 
        When adding detergent, pour liquid or powder into the designated compartment, or place pods directly in the drum before adding clothes. 
        Finally, choose the right wash cycle based on the fabric type for optimal results.
    </p>

    <h2>Dishwashing Detergent</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to dishwashing, choose the appropriate product: 
        - <strong>Dishwasher detergent</strong> for automatic machines or 
        - <strong>Hand dishwashing liquid</strong> for manual washing.
    </p>
    <p>
        For dishwashers, place the detergent in the designated compartment and follow the manufacturer's dosage guidelines. If washing by hand, apply a small amount of liquid to a sponge or dishcloth and scrub the dishes, rinsing them thoroughly afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
        For stubborn stains, consider soaking dishes in warm, soapy water before scrubbing to make cleaning easier.
    </p>

    <h2>Surface Cleaners</h2>
    <p>
        Select a surface cleaner that is suitable for the material you’re cleaning, such as countertops or floors. 
        Some concentrated cleaners may need to be diluted with water, so be sure to check the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        When applying the cleaner, spray it directly onto the surface or onto a cloth. Use a sponge or cloth to wipe down the area thoroughly, ensuring you cover all spots. In some cases, rinsing with clean water afterward may be necessary for optimal results.
    </p>

    <h2>General Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Always test cleaners on delicate surfaces before full application to ensure compatibility. 
        Store detergents out of reach of children and pets to ensure safety, and follow any safety guidelines, such as using gloves and ensuring proper ventilation when cleaning.
